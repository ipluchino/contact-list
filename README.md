# Contact List
This project is a full-stack Node.js web application which allows for the creation, observation, deletion, and modification of contact information. Pug was used for HTML templating, Bootstrap 5 for CSS styling, and Vue.js to provide a dynamic and responsive user interface. To add, delete, or update contact information an account is required and the user must be logged in. To ensure security, all account information is hashed and salted before being entered into the database. 

# Geo-located Contacts
Additionally, all contacts entered in to the website are geo-located with an accurate latitude and longitude. These geo-located maps are then placed on to an interactive map from OpenStreetMap on the home page. Contacts can be filtered by location within specified ranges of 5, 10, and 15 miles. 

## Demonstration
The contact list is hosted here: https://contact-list-kbbw.onrender.com/
